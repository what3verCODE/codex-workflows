# Databricks Analytics & System Tables

## What this source contains

Databricks is the product-analytics, data-pipeline, and warehouse-telemetry layer. It complements Datadog: Datadog is the *infra/runtime* view, Databricks is the *product/data* view (what users did, which experiments ran, how feature usage evolved, where a threshold constant came from).

- **Product analytics events.** `your_warehouse.events.analytics_track_event` (raw) and typed, deduplicated per-event dbt models in `<your_analytics_db>.<schema>.<table>`. User behavior: feature invocations, clicks, accepts/rejects, submissions, client-reported errors.
- **Usage & billing events.** `your_warehouse.events.usage_event` / `<your_analytics_db>.<schema>.stg_usage_events`; `your_warehouse.events.raw_model_event` / `<your_analytics_db>.<schema>.stg_raw_model_events`. For cost- or volume-driven decisions.
- **Experiment / feature-flag data.** Exposure and outcome tables. **Schema is company-specific.** Probe with `SHOW TABLES` before assuming names.
- **System tables.** `system.query.history`, `system.compute.warehouses`, `system.billing.*`, `system.access.audit`. Answer "was this query expensive?", "how often did anyone run this?", "when did warehouse load spike?"
- **dbt lineage.** Models in `<your_analytics_db>.<schema>` reveal what pipelines depend on a table/field; upstream changes frequently motivate consumer-code changes.
- **Databricks notebooks.** Exploratory analyses engineers wrote before code changes. **Not queryable via the SQL MCP.** If you suspect the rationale lives in a notebook, name it as a gap.

## How to search it

Inspect the available warehouse tool schemas and use read-only queries. Some integrations expose `execute_sql_read_only` and `poll_sql_result`; use their actual async result protocol rather than assuming these tool names exist.

**Orient before querying.** Schemas are company-specific; probe before trusting a table name:

```sql
SHOW TABLES IN <your_analytics_db>.<schema> LIKE '*<keyword>*';
DESCRIBE TABLE <your_analytics_db>.<schema>.stg_<event>;
```

**Time-bound every query.** These tables are huge and unconstrained scans time out. Filter on the verified event-time column, for example `_timestamp` on some event tables or `start_time` on `system.query.history` with a window bracketing the ship date, typically ~30 days before and after, wider only for strong reason.

**Inspect model definitions and lineage before selecting a table.** A maintained dbt model may provide typed, deduplicated events, but those properties and its freshness must be verified from the actual project. Raw events may be needed for an earlier schema or recent data outside a model's refresh window. Discover their fields and deduplication keys before querying.

**Example column names only.** Some event models use `_timestamp`, `_id`, `event_name`, `properties_<name>` and `context_<name>`. These are not universal conventions. Inspect the actual schema with DESCRIBE or the available catalog tools, including the event-time field and its meaning. Replace all table, model and column placeholders below with verified names.

### Investigation patterns that tend to pay off

Pick the table + column combination that matches the target:

1. **Event usage trajectory.** Daily counts on the relevant `stg_*` model across a ±30d window around the PR merge. A step function from zero to steady volume within a day or two of the merge is strong circumstantial evidence the PR launched the feature. A decay to zero suggests a deprecation or deletion.
2. **Guard-rail / defensive-check origin.** Distribution (median / p99 / max) of the relevant `properties_<name>` column in the 14 days *before* the PR. A p99 that matches the target's threshold constant suggests the number was chosen from data.
3. **Experiment / feature-flag lookup.** `SHOW TABLES ... LIKE '*experiment*'` to find the exposure table, then pull exposure counts by variant for the relevant flag key near the PR date.
4. **Query-history evidence for migrations, backfills, or perf rewrites.** `system.query.history` filtered by `statement_text ILIKE '%<table_or_symbol>%'` with a tight `start_time` window surfaces the expensive queries that likely motivated the change (sort by `total_duration_ms` or aggregate `SUM(read_bytes)`, `COUNT(*)`).
5. **dbt lineage.** If the target reads from or writes into a `<your_analytics_db>.<schema>` model, the model's own VCS history (in this repo) often carries the rationale. Hand that lead back to the source-history investigator rather than chasing it yourself.

## What good evidence looks like here

Beyond the pattern shapes above:

- An error-classifying event's count drops to near zero in the days after a defensive-code PR. Suggests the PR resolved that error class
- An exposure table row names the target's feature-flag key with a "shipped" / "concluded" decision around the PR ship date

## Common pitfalls

- **Instrumented ≠ caused.** An event's existence means someone cared enough to log it, not that the target code exists *because* of it. Pair with a PR/commit citation from the source-history investigator before claiming causation.
- **Silent instrumentation changes.** A step function in event volume may mean a new event started being logged, not that user behavior changed. Check for instrumentation PRs in the same window before reading the ramp as a feature-launch signal.
- **Schema drift.** Event properties evolve; a column on the typed dbt model today may not have existed when the target was written. Older data may carry the property only inside raw `properties_json`.
- **dbt refresh lag.** Check the model's actual refresh schedule and data completeness. Use raw events only when needed, with their verified deduplication key.
- **Company-specific tables.** Experiment, feature-flag, billing, and usage tables vary. Reporting a result from a table whose existence you never confirmed is a classic failure mode. Probe with `SHOW TABLES` / `DESCRIBE TABLE` first.
- **Retention cliff.** If the relevant window predates the table's retention or the dbt model's creation date, that's a *gap*, not a null result. Name it explicitly so the synthesizer doesn't read "no results" as "no activity."
- **Notebooks aren't queryable.** The SQL MCP can't see Databricks notebooks. If you suspect the rationale lives in one, return a gap.

## What to return

For each relevant finding:
- Type (product event / experiment exposure / usage or billing event / system-table row / dbt model)
- Fully-qualified table name and the exact query you ran
- Time window queried
- Compact numeric summary (counts, percentiles, first/last-seen timestamps). **Don't dump raw rows.**
- Temporal correlation with the target's ship date (e.g., "first row 2024-08-15; PR #49074 merged 2024-08-14")
- Relevance + strength: direct / circumstantial / weak
